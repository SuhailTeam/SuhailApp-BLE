# Suhail Mobile (BLE) — AI Context File

> This file is for AI coding assistants (Claude, GPT, Copilot, etc.) to understand the **mobile app** half of the Suhail BLE rewrite. Read this before touching anything under `mobile/`. For the server/relay half, read the root [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## What is this?

This directory holds the **React Native / Expo mobile app** that talks **directly to Mentra Live glasses over Bluetooth LE** using `@mentra/bluetooth-sdk`. It is a complete rewrite of the cloud-based Suhail app, undertaken because the team wants direct phone↔glasses control with no MentraOS Cloud dependency. The fork is `SuhailTeam/SuhailApp-BLE`; the original cloud app lives at `SuhailTeam/SuhailApp` and continues to work unchanged.

**Status:** Phase 0 — scaffold only. No code yet. The phased plan lives in the research doc at [`C:\Users\User\.claude\plans\i-want-you-to-curried-steele.md`](../../../../../.claude/plans/i-want-you-to-curried-steele.md) and is summarized in section [Phased Status](#phased-status) below.

## Two halves of this repo

| Half | Lives in | Role | Talks to |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Server / AI relay** | repo root (`src/`) | Stateless HTTPS API. Holds all secrets (OpenRouter, AWS Rekognition, ElevenLabs). Wraps the existing vision/face/intent services as REST endpoints. Deployed to Railway. | Mobile app (HTTPS) |
| **Mobile app** | `mobile/` (this dir) | Native iOS + Android app via React Native + Expo dev build. Owns session lifecycle, listening state machine, audio pipeline, UI. Holds no secrets. | Glasses (BLE) + Server (HTTPS) |

The two halves share types from [`src/types/index.ts`](../src/types/index.ts) (copied or symlinked into mobile; pick whichever works once we add tooling).

## Tech stack (target)

- **Framework:** React Native via Expo (managed workflow with native dev/prod builds — Expo Go **does not work**, the BLE SDK requires native modules)
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict)
- **Min platforms:** iOS 15.1+, Android SDK 28+
- **BLE SDK:** `@mentra/bluetooth-sdk` 0.1.6 (**beta** — pin version, watch release notes)
- **State:** Zustand (recommended; light, no boilerplate, easy to mirror our existing in-memory maps)
- **Storage:** MMKV (fast, synchronous, encrypted) for settings + last-response cache. SQLite via `op-sqlite` only if we need it for the activity log.
- **Audio:** `@mentra/bluetooth-sdk` for PCM I/O over BLE. STT + TTS via ElevenLabs Conversational AI WebSocket (the pattern from the starter kit's [`examples/react-native-elevenlabs-audio`](https://github.com/Mentra-Community/Mentra-Bluetooth-SDK-Starter-Kit/tree/main/examples/react-native-elevenlabs-audio)).
- **Builds:** `eas build` for iOS + Android. iOS requires a Mac (or EAS cloud builds).
- **Navigation:** React Navigation (native stack + bottom tabs) to match the 4-tab webview the cloud version has.
- **Package manager:** Bun (for monorepo consistency with the root server) or npm — TBD.

## Mentra Live hardware (recap)

Same hardware as the cloud version. See root [CLAUDE.md → Mentra Live Hardware](../CLAUDE.md#mentra-live-hardware). One thing to re-emphasize: **no display**. Every response goes through the glasses speaker. UI on the phone is for setup, contacts, settings, and activity log — **not** for the moment-to-moment user experience.

### Lifecycle (replaces the cloud app's `onSession` / `onStop`)

1. App boots → restores saved settings from MMKV → scans for paired glasses.
2. User pairs glasses once (system pairing flow + BLE handshake).
3. On subsequent launches, app auto-reconnects to the last-paired device.
4. While connected: subscribe to BLE event streams (button, touch, battery, mic PCM, photo, log).
5. App reacts to events: forward swipe → activate listening → stream mic PCM → call STT → route intent via `/api/intent` → execute command → speak result via TTS over BLE.
6. On disconnect: keep the app alive, attempt auto-reconnect with backoff, surface a UI state.

There is **no server-side session**. The phone IS the session.

## BLE SDK reference (essentials)

The full SDK docs live at https://bluetooth-sdk-docs.mentra.glass/. The starter kit is at https://github.com/Mentra-Community/Mentra-Bluetooth-SDK-Starter-Kit. Read both before writing BLE code. Below are the parts that map directly to features Suhail needs.

### Connection lifecycle

- Scan for glasses → request pairing → connect → subscribe to event streams.
- On disconnect, retry connection with exponential backoff (the BLE SDK does not do this for us — we have to).
- Handle Android-13+ permission flow (`BLUETOOTH_SCAN`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`, plus `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` for older SDKs).
- iOS: declare BLE usage strings in `Info.plist`; background-mode-bluetooth-central if we need background audio.

### Events from glasses (subscribe to these)

| Event | Cloud SDK equivalent | What we do with it |
|---|---|---|
| `button` (left short/long, right short/long) | `session.events.onButtonPress` | Left short = interrupt + re-listen; left long = repeat last response. Right = reserved (native camera button on Mentra Live). |
| `touch` / `swipe` | `session.events.onTouchEvent` | Forward swipe = activate listening / silence current TTS + re-listen; backward swipe = repeat last response. |
| `battery`, `case battery`, `charging`, `wifi`, `hotspot` | `session.device.state.*.onChange` | Drive the Status screen; persist last-known values in MMKV. |
| `head-up` | `session.events.onHeadPosition` | Not used today; available for future "wake on head up" feature. |
| `photo_response` (error only) | photo arrives in `requestPhoto` callback | **Only the ERROR variant is wired in `@mentra/bluetooth-sdk` 0.1.6.** The success variant is declared in the type system but never dispatched from iOS native (Bridge.swift:261 — no `sendPhotoSuccess`). Mentra's own starter-kit example uses server polling for completion; we do the same — see [Photo capture flow](#photo-capture-flow). Keep this listener for the error path (fast-fail when glasses can't capture). |
| `audio chunk` (mic PCM) | `session.events.onTranscriptionForLanguage` (but cooked) | Stream into ElevenLabs Conversational AI for STT. We get raw PCM here, not transcribed text — STT is on us. |
| `sdk log` | (none) | Pipe into our logger for debugging. |

### Outputs to glasses

| Action | Cloud SDK equivalent | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Speak text | `session.audio.speak(text)` | **No equivalent in BLE SDK.** We synthesize PCM/WAV on the phone (ElevenLabs WS) and ship audio bytes to the speaker. |
| Play short audio cue (listening / got-it / cancelled) | `session.audio.playAudio({ audioUrl })` | Bundle WAVs in the app (`assets/cues/*.wav`), ship bytes to the speaker. |
| Stop currently-playing audio | `session.audio.stopAudio(trackId)` | BLE SDK should expose a speaker stop; if not, send silence or end the active stream. |
| Capture photo | `session.camera.requestPhoto({ size: "large", compress: "medium" })` | BLE `requestPhoto(requestId, appId, size, webhookUrl, authToken, compress, sound)`. Glasses POST multipart `{photo, requestId}` to the webhook URL. Completion is detected via **server long-poll** (`/api/photo/wait/:token`), NOT via `photo_response` — see [Photo capture flow](#photo-capture-flow). Keep `large` (1920×1080) + `medium` compression — measured optimum from the cloud version. |
| LEDs | `session.led.*` | Same semantics; useful for "thinking…" feedback if we want it. |

### Things that do NOT exist in @mentra/bluetooth-sdk

- **STT (`onTranscriptionForLanguage`)** — bring your own. Default plan: ElevenLabs Conversational AI WebSocket (does STT + TTS in one round trip). Fallback: stream PCM to Railway and run Whisper there.
- **TTS (`audio.speak`)** — bring your own. Same plan.
- **`simpleStorage`** — use MMKV on device.
- **`session.layouts` / `session.dashboard`** — Mentra Live has no display; irrelevant.
- **Permission error events (`onPermissionError`)** — replaced by native OS permission flows on iOS/Android.

## Photo capture flow

Two-step, token-mediated. Mobile never base64-encodes the photo itself.

```
1. Mobile → POST /api/photo/upload-url   (HMAC-authed)
     ← { photoToken, uploadUrl, expiresAt }   // server caches an empty entry under photoToken

2. Mobile → BluetoothSdk.requestPhoto(reqId, appId, "large", uploadUrl, null, "medium", false)
   Glasses → POST multipart {photo, requestId} to uploadUrl   // NO AUTH — URL-path token IS the auth
     ← { success: true, bytes }                                // server.storeBytes() wakes any waiters

3. Mobile → GET /api/photo/wait/<token>   (HMAC-authed, server long-poll, 20s)
     ← { ok: true, bytes }                                     // resolves the instant storeBytes() fires
   (in parallel: photo_response state="error" listener — fast-fail if glasses can't capture)

4. Mobile → POST /api/vision/scene  { photoToken, language }    ── │ parallel
            POST /api/faces/recognize-all  { photoToken }        ── │
     ← results
```

**Why the long-poll instead of the BLE `photo_response` success event:** `@mentra/bluetooth-sdk` 0.1.6's iOS bridge has `sendPhotoError` but no `sendPhotoSuccess` (Bridge.swift:261 — verified). The success variant is in the Swift type model but never dispatched to JS. Mentra's own starter-kit example (`examples/react-native/src/useBluetoothSdkExample.ts`) uses server polling for completion for the same reason — `photo_response` is documented as "acknowledgment, not completion."

**Server-side cache** (`src/services/photo-cache.ts`): in-memory `Map<token, PhotoEntry>` with 60s TTL, 20-entry cap, sweeper every 30s. `getBytes()` is non-evicting so describe-scene can read the same photo from both `/api/vision/scene` and `/api/faces/recognize-all` in parallel. `waitForBytes()` does the long-poll. Optional `evict()` for callers that want to free early.

**Mobile-side wrapper** (`mobile/src/ble/camera.ts`): `capturePhoto({ signal, size, compress })` orchestrates the whole dance. Races three signals — wait endpoint success, BLE `photo_response` error variant, 25s outer timeout. Cleans up the listener + timer + abort handler in `finally`.

## Audio pipeline (the critical piece)

This is the highest-risk part of the rewrite. Latency targets:

| Span | Cloud version (measured) | BLE target |
|---|---|---|
| Swipe → "listening" cue | ~150 ms | ≤ 200 ms |
| End of user speech → first token of result | ~1.5-2.0 s | ≤ 2.5 s |
| End of vision call → first audio byte to speaker | ~600-900 ms | ≤ 1.0 s |
| Total swipe → first spoken word of response | ~3-4 s | ≤ 5 s |

### Audio OUTPUT path (confirmed on iOS hardware)

**Mentra Live presents itself as both a BLE peripheral (data) and a Bluetooth Classic A2DP audio sink.** When iOS pairs over BLE through `@mentra/bluetooth-sdk`, the A2DP audio profile auto-pairs alongside it. From the OS perspective, the glasses speaker is just a regular Bluetooth audio output.

Implications:
- **No A2DP pairing UX needed in the app.** The `audio_pairing_needed` SDK event handler can be a no-op / fallback only.
- **TTS playback** = `/api/tts` bytes → temp file → play with `expo-audio` → routes to default Bluetooth output automatically.
- **Audio cues** = bundled WAVs in `mobile/assets/cues/` → play the same way.
- **Mic / speaker arbitration**: call `BluetoothSdk.setOwnAppAudioPlaying(true)` before any playback and `(false)` after. The SDK uses this to manage mic state during speech.
- **No multi-track concept** like the cloud's `trackId: 2` — there is no BLE audio channel to multiplex onto. **Serialize** speech and cues through a single playback queue.

### Audio INPUT path (mic)

Glasses mic emits PCM via the SDK's `mic_pcm` event after calling `BluetoothSdk.setMicState(enabled=true, useGlassesMic=true, ...)`. Format is fixed: **16 kHz, 16-bit signed LE, mono, `pcm_s16le`**. VAD-gated by default.

Two STT architectures still on the table:

**Option A — ElevenLabs Conversational AI direct** (matches starter kit example)
- PCM → WebSocket to ElevenLabs CAI → text (STT) + audio (TTS) back.
- Pros: one WebSocket, fastest, no Railway hop for the audio path.
- Cons: phone needs an ephemeral signed URL from Railway (we add `/api/tts/token`); CAI agent must be configured on ElevenLabs side.
- Real key never leaves Railway. Mobile holds short-lived (~5 min) signed URL.

**Option B — Stream PCM to Railway, do STT there**
- PCM → HTTPS chunks (or a single batched POST) to Railway → Whisper / Scribe / similar → text back.
- Pros: no secrets on phone, easy to swap STT providers, easier to log/analyze.
- Cons: extra hop, more latency, Railway becomes a real-time audio relay (more failure surface).

Default plan: **measure both with the ported `timeline.ts` before locking in.** Start with Option B because it's the lowest moving-parts path to a working slice (no CAI agent setup), then evaluate A if latency is unacceptable.

### Audio cues

Pre-generated WAV files bundled at `mobile/assets/cues/listening.wav`, `got-it.wav`, `cancelled.wav`. The cloud version generates these server-side at startup ([`src/services/cue-service.ts`](../src/services/cue-service.ts)); for mobile we pre-generate them at build time (or generate-once-at-first-launch) and play through `expo-audio`. Saves ~2.5-3s vs TTS cues.

## Listening state machine

Port the **exact** semantics from [`src/app.ts:62-68, 252-325`](../src/app.ts). Constants live in `mobile/src/state/listening.ts`:

- States: `idle` | `active` | `processing`
- `LISTENING_TIMEOUT_MS` = 10_000 — auto return to idle if no command received
- `LISTENING_GRACE_MS` = 1_000 — ignore stale transcriptions immediately after activation
- `TTS_ECHO_BUFFER_MS` = 1_500 — mark session as "speaking" during TTS + 1.5s buffer, ignore mic during that window
- `MIN_CONFIDENCE` = 0.55 — reject low-confidence transcriptions

Transitions:
- Forward swipe (any state) → active. If was processing, also silence current TTS first ("forward swipe during processing").
- Left short press during active or processing → cancel, return to active (re-listen).
- Backward swipe / left long press (any state) → speak `lastResponse` if available.
- Active + 10s no input → idle.
- Active + valid transcription → processing.
- Processing complete → idle.
- **Glasses disconnect (active/processing, or enrollment pending) → abort + speak `glassesDisconnected`.** Connection state can't be observed via `addListener` (the public event map omits `glasses_status`), so `ble/connection.ts` keeps a small imperative store (`isGlassesConnected`/`onGlassesDisconnected`/`setGlassesConnected`) fed from the React session by HomeScreen. `camera.ts` fail-fasts on it (pre-check + a disconnect racer alongside wait/error/timeout) so a mid-command BLE drop fails in <1s instead of hanging out the 25s `CAPTURE_TIMEOUT_MS`; the listening machine aborts in-flight work and speaks the notice (kept out of the generic-error path via the `GLASSES_DISCONNECTED_ERROR` marker). `lastResponse` is preserved across the drop.

Recreate the `pendingEnrollments` map for the 2-step face enrollment flow — see [`src/commands/face-enroll.ts`](../src/commands/face-enroll.ts) for the exact 30s timeout + TTS echo detection + concurrency lock.

## Commands status

All 8 live in [`src/commands/`](../src/commands/) (cloud) and `mobile/src/commands/` (mobile). Cloud handlers are the **specification** for the mobile equivalents.

| # | Command | Cloud handler | Mobile handler | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `scene-summarize` | [scene-summarize.ts](../src/commands/scene-summarize.ts) | [describe.ts](src/commands/describe.ts) | **Shipped** (slice 3b) |
| 2 | `ocr-read-text` | [ocr-read-text.ts](../src/commands/ocr-read-text.ts) | [read.ts](src/commands/read.ts) | **Shipped** (slice 3c) |
| 3 | `color-detect` | [color-detect.ts](../src/commands/color-detect.ts) | [color.ts](src/commands/color.ts) | **Shipped** (slice 3c) |
| 4 | `find-object` | [find-object.ts](../src/commands/find-object.ts) | [find.ts](src/commands/find.ts) | **Shipped** (slice 3c) |
| 5 | `face-recognize` | [face-recognize.ts](../src/commands/face-recognize.ts) | [who.ts](src/commands/who.ts) | **Shipped** (slice 3c) |
| 6 | `currency-recognize` | [currency-recognize.ts](../src/commands/currency-recognize.ts) | [money.ts](src/commands/money.ts) | **Shipped** (slice 3c) |
| 7 | `visual-qa` | [visual-qa.ts](../src/commands/visual-qa.ts) | [vqa.ts](src/commands/vqa.ts) | **Shipped** (slice 3c) |
| 8 | `face-enroll` | [face-enroll.ts](../src/commands/face-enroll.ts) | [enroll.ts](src/commands/enroll.ts) | **Shipped** (slice 3d — stateful 2-step + 30s timeout) |

Each ported command:
- captures a photo via [`mobile/src/ble/camera.ts`](src/ble/camera.ts) → server long-poll completion
- calls one or two [`mobile/src/relay/{vision,faces}.ts`](src/relay/) endpoints with `{ photoToken }`
- returns the spoken text (the listening state machine speaks it + updates `lastResponse`)
- throws on failure → dispatcher catches → speaks `generalError`

For the **legacy "port in this order" guidance** (kept for reference):

| # | Command | Cloud handler | Railway endpoint | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `describe` (scene-summarize) | [scene-summarize.ts](../src/commands/scene-summarize.ts) | `POST /api/vision/scene` + `POST /api/faces/recognize-all` (parallel) | Prepend recognized names to scene. **Reference flow.** |
| 2 | `read` (OCR) | [ocr-read-text.ts](../src/commands/ocr-read-text.ts) | `POST /api/vision/ocr` | Cap at `OCR_MAX_CHARS=400`, append "swipe to stop" hint. |
| 3 | `color` | [color-detect.ts](../src/commands/color-detect.ts) | `POST /api/vision/color` | Trivial after #1. |
| 4 | `money` (currency) | [currency-recognize.ts](../src/commands/currency-recognize.ts) | `POST /api/vision/currency` | Multi-bill counting; RTL number formatting in Arabic. |
| 5 | `find` (object) | [find-object.ts](../src/commands/find-object.ts) | `POST /api/vision/object` | Parameter extraction in router. |
| 6 | `who` (face-recognize) | [face-recognize.ts](../src/commands/face-recognize.ts) | `POST /api/faces/recognize-all` | Multi-face. |
| 7 | `enroll` | [face-enroll.ts](../src/commands/face-enroll.ts) | `POST /api/faces/enroll` | Stateful 2-step; preserve all safeguards. |
| 8 | VQA | [visual-qa.ts](../src/commands/visual-qa.ts) | `POST /api/vision/vqa` | Fallback for unmatched intents. |

The intent router is also a Railway call: `POST /api/intent` with `{ text, language }` returns `{ command, params, confidence }`. Keyword fallback runs client-side if Railway is slow / unreachable (port the keyword table from [`src/commands/command-router.ts`](../src/commands/command-router.ts)).

## Railway relay contract

The mobile app talks to the Railway server via these endpoints. The server implementation lives in `src/` (TypeScript, Bun) and reuses the existing service code. See root [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for the server-side details once those endpoints are built.

| Endpoint | Method | Body | Returns | Wraps |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `/api/intent` | POST | `{ text, language }` | `{ command, params, confidence }` | [command-router.ts](../src/commands/command-router.ts) |
| `/api/vision/scene` | POST | `{ image: base64, language }` | `{ description }` | [vision-service.ts → describeScene](../src/services/vision-service.ts) |
| `/api/vision/ocr` | POST | `{ image: base64, language }` | `{ text, truncated }` | vision-service → extractText |
| `/api/vision/currency` | POST | `{ image: base64, language }` | `{ bills: [...], total, currency }` | vision-service → recognizeCurrency |
| `/api/vision/object` | POST | `{ image: base64, target, language }` | `{ location }` | vision-service → detectObject |
| `/api/vision/color` | POST | `{ image: base64, language }` | `{ name, hex }` | vision-service → detectColor |
| `/api/vision/vqa` | POST | `{ image: base64, question, language }` | `{ answer }` | vision-service → answerVisualQuestion |
| `/api/faces/recognize` | POST | `{ image: base64 }` | `{ name, confidence } \| null` | [face-service.ts → recognizeFace](../src/services/face-service.ts) |
| `/api/faces/recognize-all` | POST | `{ image: base64 }` | `{ faces: [...], totalDetected }` | face-service → recognizeAllFaces |
| `/api/faces/enroll` | POST | `{ image: base64, name }` | `{ faceId, name, enrolledAt }` | face-service → enrollFace |
| `/api/faces` | GET | — | `{ faces: [...], count }` | face-service → listFaces |
| `/api/faces/:id` | DELETE | — | `{ ok: true }` | face-service → deleteFace |
| `/api/faces/:id` | PUT | `{ name }` | `{ ok: true }` | face-service → renameFace |
| `/api/faces/:id/photo` | GET | — | image bytes | reads `data/faces/:id.jpg` |
| `/api/tts` | POST | `{ text, voicePreset?, voiceId?, speed?, format? }` | audio bytes (Content-Type per format, `X-Audio-Format` header echoes choice) | server-side ElevenLabs TTS; default `format=mp3_44100_128`. Accepts `mp3_*`, `pcm_*` (8/16/22/24/44 kHz, 16-bit LE mono), and `ulaw_8000`. Returns 503 if `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` is unset, 413 if text > 5000 chars. |
| `/api/tts/token` *(deferred)* | POST | TBD | TBD | will mint a short-lived ElevenLabs Conversational AI signed URL when we set up a CAI agent. Not implemented yet — use `/api/tts` for now. |

### Auth

Per-device HMAC token. Device generates a UUID on first launch (stored in MMKV). On every request, header `Authorization: Bearer <HMAC(deviceId, sharedSecret)>`. Railway holds `RELAY_SHARED_SECRET`. Token is **not** a real auth — it's a soft rate-limiter to prevent random scraping. For real auth, swap to OAuth or Mentra account integration later.

### Versioning

`POST /api/*` accepts an `X-Suhail-Mobile-Version` header. Railway can refuse or warn if the mobile version is too old. Bump `mobile/package.json` version on each release.

## Bilingual support

Same model as the cloud version. The `messages` constant in [`src/services/tts-service.ts`](../src/services/tts-service.ts) is the source of truth — copy verbatim into `mobile/src/i18n/messages.ts` as a TS constants file. Don't introduce a new i18n framework just for this — a flat constants object plus `language` from settings is enough.

Language detection: respect the user's selected language (`settings.language`). Do NOT auto-detect from STT (we already learned that lesson with `onTranscriptionForLanguage` vs `onTranscription`).

RTL: required when language is Arabic. React Native has `I18nManager.forceRTL(true)`. Plan: set on app boot based on `settings.language`; if changed, the app needs to restart (`Updates.reloadAsync()` from `expo-updates`) for layout to flip. This is fine, matches what users expect from RTL toggles.

## Settings

Same shape as [`src/services/settings-store.ts`](../src/services/settings-store.ts):

```ts
interface AppSettings {
  speechSpeed: number;   // 0.5 - 2.0
  volume: number;        // 0.0 - 1.0
  voicePreset: "default" | "male" | "female";
  language: "ar" | "en";
}
```

Storage: MMKV. Defaults: `{ speechSpeed: 1.0, volume: 1.0, voicePreset: "default", language: "ar" }`. Validation/clamping same as the cloud version.

## Environment variables (mobile)

Mobile env vars are baked into the build (anything with `EXPO_PUBLIC_` is exposed at runtime). Keep secrets OFF the device.

| Var | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_RELAY_BASE_URL` | Railway base URL (no trailing slash) | (none — must set) |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_RELAY_SHARED_SECRET` | HMAC secret for device auth. **Soft secret only** — bundled in app. Rotate by re-releasing. | (none) |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry crash reporting (Phase F) | (empty) |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_LOG_LEVEL` | `debug` / `info` / `warn` / `error` | `info` |

`.env.example` lives in `mobile/.env.example` — keep it in sync as we add vars. The root `.env.example` covers the Railway server.

## Project structure (planned)

Currently this directory only contains this file. As work proceeds, the layout should look like:

## Phased status

| Phase | Goal | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **0** | Repo fork + this CLAUDE.md | **In progress (you are here)** |
| **A** | Railway relay endpoints (`/api/intent`, `/api/vision/*`, `/api/faces/*`, `/api/tts/token`) live alongside the existing MentraOS server | Not started |
| **B** | RN scaffold + BLE handshake + button/swipe events visible in the app | Not started |
| **C** | Audio pipeline end-to-end (PCM → STT → text → TTS → speaker) over BLE | Not started |
| **D** | Port all 8 commands one at a time | Not started |
| **E** | Companion UI (4 screens) + polish | Not started |
| **F** | Hardening + merge back to `main` | Not started |

Each phase ends with hardware verification on Mentra Live. Don't proceed to the next phase until the current one is demoable.

## Rules for contributing (mobile-specific)

These extend the rules in root [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md), they don't replace them.

1. **No secrets in the app.** OpenRouter, AWS, full ElevenLabs keys live on Railway. The phone only ever holds the shared HMAC secret (soft) and short-lived tokens minted by Railway.
2. **No Expo Go.** Always test on a dev build. CI runs `eas build --profile development`.
3. **Audio only (still).** UI is for setup / settings / contacts / activity. The voice command flow has zero on-screen dependence. A blind user must be able to use the core flow with the phone in their pocket and the screen off.
4. **Preserve cloud semantics.** Listening timeouts, echo buffer, grace period, OCR cap, RTL number formatting — these were tuned with users. Don't change them without a measured reason.
5. **Test on real Mentra Live hardware.** Simulators do not have BLE. Every PR that touches BLE, audio, or commands needs a hardware test note.
6. **Measure before optimizing.** Port [`src/utils/timeline.ts`](../src/utils/timeline.ts) early. Every command span goes through it. Latency is a first-class metric.
7. **Keep both halves in sync.** When you add a new Railway endpoint, update the table in this file. When you change `AppSettings` shape, update both `src/services/settings-store.ts` and `mobile/src/state/settings.ts`. When you change bilingual messages, update both copies.
8. **Don't reach into the cloud app code at runtime.** Only at design time (as a spec to copy from). The mobile app's only runtime dependency on `SuhailTeam/*` is the Railway relay's HTTP API.
9. **Keep `mobile/.env.example` and `mobile/package.json` up to date.** Same hygiene as the server side.
10. **Bun or npm — pick one and don't mix.** Decide in Phase B; document the choice here.

## Adding a new command (mobile-side)

After the relay endpoint exists:

1. Create `mobile/src/commands/<name>.ts` with a single `execute(deps)` function. Pattern: capture photo → call Railway endpoint → speak result. Mirror the shape of [`src/commands/base-command.ts`](../src/commands/base-command.ts) (try/catch + 5s photo timeout + pre-capture fallback + friendly error speech).
2. Add the command to the keyword fallback table in `mobile/src/state/listening.ts` (in case the LLM intent router times out).
3. Add to the command dispatcher in `mobile/src/state/listening.ts` (the equivalent of `this.handlers` in the cloud `app.ts`).
4. Add a real hardware test to the verification list in [the research doc](../../../../../.claude/plans/i-want-you-to-curried-steele.md#7-verification--how-wed-know-the-rewrite-is-done).

## Commands quick reference (mobile dev workflow)

These don't work yet — listed for when Phase B lands.

```bash
# Inside mobile/
bun install                           # or npm install — TBD
bunx expo start --dev-client          # Start Metro for dev build
eas build --profile development --platform ios       # iOS dev build (requires Mac or EAS cloud)
eas build --profile development --platform android   # Android dev build
eas build --profile production --platform all        # Production builds for both
bun run typecheck                     # tsc --noEmit
```
